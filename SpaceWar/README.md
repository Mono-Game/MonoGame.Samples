# SpaceWar Sample

[![SpaceWar Sample](Content/Textures/Spacewar_Title_FINAL.jpg)

This project shows you how to make a Geometry Wars-inspired twin-stick shooter, with neon graphics, crazy particle effects, and awesome music.

Find the original XNA sample currently archived in the [XNAGameStudioArchive](https://github.com/simondarksidej/XNAGameStudio/wiki/Spacewar)

The tutorial includes:

* A classic 2D SpaceWar rendering loop - showing the original [SpaceWar game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!)
* An updated 3D SpaceWar clone with more graphical effects and shaders, gameplay is roughly the same

> This sample has been archived separately for prosperity as it is not fully functional following its migration to MonoGame.  It is a work in progress only.
