## Building the samples

These samples can either be opened and built in Visual Studio for Mac or Windows, alternatively they can be built with the .NET Core tool chain 

For more details on building projects with the .NET Core tools, please see [this guide on the MonoGame documentation site](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/packaging_games.html).

## SpaceWar Limitations

SpaceWar is not a complete sample as it has issues from its original XNA migration to MonoGame.  This sample is provided "as is", but may be updated in the future.

For more details on the platforms supported by MonoGame, please see the [Platforms Guide](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/platforms/0_platforms.html) on the MonoGame Documentation site
